This is the capstone project for WGU's Bachelor of Computer Science program.

The goal is to create a Python application utilizing machine learning to describe or predict information pertinent to a chosen dataset.
This project uses SKLearn and matplotlib, as well as other necessary ML libraries to split and read a set of labeled spam and non-spam emails and then apply predictive machine learning to determine the likelihood that 
test set emails should be flagged as spam.
It also includes a simple GUI utilizing tkinter.
